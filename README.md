# Data Mining Project: Customer Segmentation using Clustering

## Project Overview
This project focuses on applying various Data Mining clustering techniques to a fictional **Mall Customer Dataset** to identify distinct customer segments and hidden behavioral patterns. The segmentation aims to provide actionable insights for personalized marketing, targeted product recommendations, and improved customer relationship management (CRM).

The project explores and compares four key clustering algorithms: **K-Means**, **AGNES**, **DIANA**, and **DBSCAN**.
